# Nerf-MA40-Full-Auto

This file set is an almost drop in replacemnt for the semi automatic pusher to convert the Nerf MA40 into a full auto firing blaster. 

Note that the hardware is all flycore except the pusher bolt, I need to redesign for an M3 instead of an M2

## Hardware

(3) M2.6x12mm toy screws

(1) M2x6mm socket head bolt

(1) M2 nut

(1) N20 Motor (1000 rpm or below, higher rpm motors have insuffiucent torque and burn out)

(1) Cherry DB2 style switch 

If an Omron/Tezuo style microswitch is used for the trigger 

(2) M2.6x12mm toy screws

## Wiring

Its set up just like a flycore blaster so just wire the same way. 

I've included the PDF assembly guide of a QUIK so decide which wiring option you prefer and do that.

## 3D Printing

I found these orientations work best, a little support is needed on the pusher and motor mount.

## Blaster Modificatons 

There are some tabs and walls needed to be cut for the pusher and cables to fit, 
but none of them interact with the original pusher so if you ever want to convert back to semi auto you can.

And thats all, have fun using your slightly more game accurate MA40 (in game the RPM is 720 so decide on your N20 motor accordingly)
